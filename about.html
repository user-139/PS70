		<p class="paragraph"> I am a senior in Quincy House from the town of Marshall, Michigan. <br> I concentrate in Government on the Public Policy track with a focus on American defense policy. <br> This semester, when I'm not working on my PS70 projects, I'll be writing a thesis evaluating the account of the origin of the Union offered in Lincoln's First Inaugural Address. <br> I decided to take this class because I figured I should complement my humanities-focused education with some practical skills. <br> I don't have much experience in fabrication or programming, so I'm looking forward to getting started! </p>
