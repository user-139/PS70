		<br> <h1 class="header"> Jeopardy! Trainer </h1> <br>
		<p class="paragraph"> I've wanted to be on Jeopardy for a long time. This summer, I started going through their audition process and am currently waiting to see if I will be given a chance to compete on the show. In the meantime, I need to keep training. As it happens, knowing the trivia is only half the battle: if you can't beat the other contestants on the buzzer, you won't have a chance. To help me with this problem, my final project idea is to create a buzzer trainer that replicates actual game conditions as much as possible. </p> <br>

		<p class="paragraph"> At its most basic, the device will have a buzzer for the player to use, an indicator light, and a separate buzzer for a friend to turn the device on and off. In a regular game of Jeopardy, one of the show's employees activates the players' buzzers after the host finishes reading the question. If you buzz in too early, your buzzer deactivates for a moment, typically allowing another player to jump in. As such, if the player buzzes in too early, the light will turn red. When the buzzer turns on, however, the light will turn white until the player buzzes in, where it will turn green. An attached computer can keep statistics on reaction time and false buzzes, helping me get a sense of my improvement (or lack thereof) over time. Depending on how the project develops, there are some additional elements I might include as well: <br> <br> -Three buzzers to practice playing an actual game <br><br> -A text-to-voice system that reads questions directly from the computer and automatically turns the buzzer on at the end <br><br> -Audio output so the device actually buzzes when the button is pressed, with different tones depending on whether the buzz is too early</p> <br>
